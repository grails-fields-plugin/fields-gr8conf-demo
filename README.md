This is a demo application for my talk _Future-proof scaffolding with the Fields plugin_ at [GR8Conf US 2012](http://gr8conf.us/)

The repository is organized into numbered branches that progressively introduce more features of the plugin. Start at _1-standard-scaffolding_ and use `grails run-app` to start the application. You should be able to switch between branches without having to restart the Grails application.
